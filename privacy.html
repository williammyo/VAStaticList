  <title>Privacy Policy – VA Disability Static List</title>

<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: April 12, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the data handling practices of the <strong>VA Disability Static List</strong> Chrome
    Extension ("the Extension"). This extension is developed and maintained by an individual developer and is not
    affiliated with or endorsed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>The Extension is a browser tool designed to enhance the readability of publicly accessible information on <a
      href="https://va.gov" target="_blank">VA.gov</a> by displaying structured data related to service-connected
    disabilities, such as static indicators, ratings, and diagnostic codes. The Extension operates entirely within the
    user's browser and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive information.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p><strong>No personal data is collected.</strong> The Extension does not collect, transmit, sync, store, or share any
    data with external servers or third parties. All processing occurs locally on the user’s device.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No tracking cookies are used</li>
    <li>No IP addresses, names, emails, or VA credentials are accessed or recorded</li>
    <li>No user interactions are logged</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension requires access to VA.gov claim pages in order to display data available to the logged-in user. It
    uses Chrome’s <code>activeTab</code> and <code>scripting</code> APIs solely for the purpose of parsing and
    presenting data already visible on the page to the user. These permissions are declared transparently in the
    <code>manifest.json</code> file and are required only while the user is actively browsing VA.gov.</p>

  <h2>4. Compliance with Chrome Web Store Policy</h2>
  <p>This extension complies with Google’s <a
      href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/#user-data" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store
      User Data Policy</a>. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is not sold, shared, or transferred to third parties</li>
    <li>No data is used for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
    <li>The extension does not access beyond the scope necessary for core functionality</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Compliance with Global Privacy Regulations</h2>
  <p>Although no data is collected or stored, the Extension aligns with global privacy standards, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR – Regulation (EU) 2016/679)</strong> – No personal data is
      processed under Article 4, and no consent is required under Article 6.</li>
    <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA – Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100–1798.199)</strong> – No personal
      information is collected or sold, and users retain full privacy and control over their data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>Because this extension does not transmit or store any data, it minimizes all risk associated with user information
    leakage. It runs entirely client-side and does not maintain any backend services or databases.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The Extension is not affiliated with or endorsed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or any government
    agency. It is intended for informational and convenience purposes only. Users are encouraged to verify any
    disability claim details with official VA channels.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
